NAME
----
demo - run media delivery demo

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'demo' [<options>] [<command> [<args>]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`demo` is a helper script to operate media delivery demo.

If <command> is not specified, it starts nginx server and awaits external incoming
client requests. Issue the one requesting playback via vlc from the host or some other
system on the network:

------------
   vlc http://localhost:8080/<stream>/index.m3u8
------------
or capturing via ffmpeg:
------------
   ffmpeg -i http://localhost:8080/<stream>/index.m3u8 -c copy /tmp/output.mkv
------------

'streams' command returns list of streams available for playback and exits.

'ffmpeg' command toggles ffmpeg demo mode which runs ffmpeg client within the container.
No interaction from host or other system is required. Example:
------------
   $ demo ffmpeg <stream>
------------

`-<n>` option is useful for demo purposes. With it solution pretends to have <n> copies of
each input stream. Execute 'demo -4 streams' to explore the difference.
