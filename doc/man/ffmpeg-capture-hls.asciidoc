ffmpeg-capture-hls(1)
=====================

NAME
----
ffmpeg-capture-hls - capture HLS stream(s) to the file(s)

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ffmpeg-capture-hls.sh' [<options>] <stream> [<stream>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Helper script which is used to trigger HLS streaming and capture it to the file.
Script recognizes the following stream specifications:

* http://localhost:8080/<stream>/index.m3u8
* <stream> aka http://localhost:8080/<stream>/index.m3u8

Script starts the capture in the background process and enters monitoring
loop. If terminal is attached you can exit from it with CTRL^C. Upon
exit script will enter bash shell for you to wander about. If
'--exit' option was specified, script will exit automatically
upon capturing all the streams. If terminal is not attached, the monitoring
loop will produce output to `stdout`.

If the script was called as
------------
ffmpeg-capture-hls.sh vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio
------------
or as
------------
ffmpeg-capture-hls.sh http://localhost:8080/vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio/index.m3u8
------------
which is the same, then you should see the following output from the
monitoring loop:

------------
ffmpeg streaming clients monitor
================================
Output and logs path: /opt/data/artifacts/ffmpeg-hls-client
Total clients: 1
Running clients: 1
  vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio: size=8.0M, frames=250, fps=24
Completed clients: 0
------------

It says that there is a single client being monitored (`Total clients`).
It is currently running (`Running clients`) and its running status is as
follows: file being captured is `vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio`,
currently 8.0M were received which is around 250 frames and average receiving
speed is 24 fps.

Upon completion you will see something similar to the following:
------------
ffmpeg streaming clients monitor
================================
Output and logs path: /opt/data/artifacts/ffmpeg-hls-client
Total clients: 1
Running clients: 0
Completed clients: 1
  vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio: size=54M, frames=3443, fps=24, status=0
------------
Pay attention that monitoring loop report status of the completed ffmpeg
capturing.

Mind that monitoring loop relies on ffmpeg output reporting number of
received frames and speed (in fps). ffmpeg reports this data with some
delay, so be patient. As of now there is no way to control ffmpeg reporting
frequency.

OPTIONS
-------
--exit::
	Exit from the demo once all streams will be completed on client side.
