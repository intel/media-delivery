demo-bash(1)
============

NAME
----
demo-bash - media delivery containers entrypoint

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'demo-bash' [<command> [<arguments>]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'demo-bash' is media delivery container's entrypoint. It gets executed anytime
you try to run anything via container. This script ensures that the correct
environment is setup. It consists of the following steps. First it runs
`source /etc/demo.env` to set the demo environment variables. Then it executes
`demo-setup` script which sets up the demo environment and returns a non-zero
exit status in case of any errors. If 'demo-bash' sees an error form `demo-setup`
it exits immediately dumping error message to `stderr`. This behavior can be
overridden with `MDS_IGNORE_ERRORS=yes` environment variable.

Assuming that `demo-setup` succeeded, 'demo-bash' verifies whether any groups
were adjusted and re-enters shell if needed.

In the very end 'demo-bash' executes the specified command.

Media delivery containers are configured in a way that if no command is
specified they would just enter shell maybe displaying some welcome
messages. This is done by 'hello-bash' script which gets passed to
'demo-bash' as a command. This is done by container configuration rather
than 'demo-bash' itself, so 'hello-bash' existence is actually transparent
to 'demo-bash'.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

MDS_IGNORE_ERRORS=yes|no::
	Ignore any errors during demo setup and enter the container. This
can be useful if you want to check container structure or component versions
without really running the demo on a system without GPU. (default: `no`)
