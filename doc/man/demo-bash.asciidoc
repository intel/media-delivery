============

NAME
----
demo-bash - media delivery containers entrypoint

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'demo-bash' [<command> [<arguments>]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'demo-bash' is media delivery containers entrypoint. It gets executed anytime
you try to run anything via container. This script assures that correct
environment is setup and acts as follows. First it `source /etc/demo.env` to
get demo environment variables. Then it executes `demo-setup` script which
should setup demo environment and return non-zero exit status in case of
any errors. If 'demo-bash' sees an error form `demo-setup` it exits
immediately dumping error message to `stderr`. This behavior can be
overwritten with `MDS_IGNORE_ERRORS=yes` enviroment variable.

Assuming that `demo-setup` succeeded 'demo-bash' verifies whether any groups
were adjusted and reenters shell if needed.

In the very end 'demo-bash' executes specified command.

Media delivery containers are configured in a way that if no command is
specified they would just enter shell maybe displaying some welcome
messages. This is done by 'hello-bash' script which gets passed to
'demo-bash' as a command. This is done by container configuration rather
than 'demo-bash' itself, so 'hello-bash' existence is actually transparent
to 'demo-bash'.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

MDS_IGNORE_ERRORS=yes|no::
	Ignore any errors during demo setup and enter the container. This
can be useful if you want to check container structure or component versions
without really running the demo on a system without GPU. (default: `no`)
