monitor-nginx-server(1)
=======================

NAME
----
monitor-nginx-server - monitor running nginx server for media transcoding

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'monitor-ngingx-server.sh'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Helper script used to monitor HLS streaming from the server side. You can exit from
the script with CTRL^C. You should see the following output:

------------
nginx server monitor
====================
Logs path: /opt/data/artifacts/ffmpeg-hls-server
Total requests: 1
Running requests: 1
  vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio: frames=250, fps=24, fragments=1
Completed requests: 0
------------

It says that there is a single request being processed (`Total requests`).
It is currently running (`Running requests`) and its running status is as
follows: stream being produced is `vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio`,
250 frames transcoded and average transcoding speed is 24 fps, number of
produce HLS fragments is 1.

Upon completion you will see something similar to the following:
------------
nginx server monitor
====================
Logs path: /opt/data/artifacts/ffmpeg-hls-server
Total requests: 1
Running requests: 0
Completed requests: 1
  vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio: frames=3443, fps=24, fragments=14, status=0
------------
Pay attention that monitoring loop reports status of the completed ffmpeg
transcoding.

Mind that monitoring loop relies on ffmpeg output reporting number of
transcoded frames and speed (in fps). ffmpeg reports this data with some
delay, so be patient. As of now there is no way to control ffmpeg reporting
frequency.
