demo-ffmpeg(1)
==============

NAME
----
demo-ffmpeg - run demo w/ ffmpeg client

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'demo ffmpeg' [<options>] <stream> [<stream>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run demo w/ ffmpeg client(s). ffmpeg will catch streaming video
and dump it to the disk.

`<stream>` must be an HLS stream name obtained from
link:demo-streams.asciidoc[demo-streams]. Mind that since 'demo-ffmpeg' runs
inside a container, you can actually use `localhost` instead of real
container IP address. Also, simplified stream names are accepted as
`vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio` which would stand for
`http://172.17.0.2:8080/vod/avc/WAR_TRAILER_HiQ_10_withAudio/index.m3u8`
(real IP address might be different).

OPTIONS
-------
--exit::
	Exit from the demo once all streams will be completed on client side.
