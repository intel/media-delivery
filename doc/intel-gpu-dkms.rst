Intel GPU DKMS
==============

It is required to install special Kernel Mode Drivers (KMD) to enable support of some new Intel GPUs.
This article describes setup of these KMDs targeting the following GPUs:

* DG2
* ATS-M

Overall, the following items should be taken care of:

* `Intel GPU Firmware <https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-firmware>`_
* `Backport of i915 Graphics Driver <https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports>`_
* `Backport of Converged Security Engine Driver <https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-cse-backports>`_
* `Backport of Intel Platform Telemetry Driver <https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-pmt-backports>`_

DKMS packages are being built against specific kernel version. Please, refer to documentation
in above projects for the full list of supported Operating Systems and kernels. In this
article we will demonstrate installation for the specific version of Ubuntu 20.04 OEM kernel.

First, install the following Ubuntu 20.04 OEM kernel (this kernel version corresponds to the
version used below to build DKMS packages)::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-5.14.0-1033-oem linux-image-unsigned-5.14.0-1033-oem

Once done, check kernel boot order in grub to make sure to boot into the installed kernel,
adjust if needed, then reboot::

  sudo reboot

Clone media-delivery repository and use helper docker (see `Dockerfile <../docker/ubuntu20.04/dkms/Dockerfile>`_)
to build Intel GPU DKMS packages. Run the following from the top level of media-delivery
cloned copy::

  docker build \
    $(env | grep -E '(_proxy=|_PROXY)' | sed 's/^/--build-arg /') \
    --file docker/ubuntu20.04/dkms/Dockerfile \
    --tag dkms \
    .

Copy Intel GPU DKMS to the host system::

  sudo mkdir -p /opt/packages/
  sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /opt/packages
  docker run -it --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v /opt/packages/:/opt/packages/ dkms \
    /bin/bash -c "cp -rd /opt/dist/* /opt/packages/"

Install Intel GPU Firmware and DKMS packages::

  sudo mkdir -p /lib/firmware/updates/i915/
  sudo cp /opt/packages/firmware/*.bin /lib/firmware/updates/i915/
  sudo dpkg -i /opt/packages/intel-gpgpu-dkms-ubuntu-5.14-oem_5606.220414.0_all.deb
  sudo dpkg -i /opt/packages/intel-platform-cse-dkms-2022.7.deb
  sudo dpkg -i /opt/packages/intel-platform-pmt-dkms-2021.21.deb

Once done, reboot::

  sudo reboot

That's it. Now you should be able to use Intel GPU targeted by these DKMS packages (DG2 or ATS-M).

To verify that DKMS were installed correctly, check ``dmesg`` logs right after the boot. First,
verify that DKMS driver backports got recognized and loaded::

  $ sudo dmesg |grep -i backport
  [    5.578889] COMPAT BACKPORTED INIT
  [    5.582781] Loading modules backported from DII_5606_prerelease

  [    5.685969] [drm] I915 BACKPORTED INIT
  [    9.013124] [drm] I915 SPI BACKPORTED INIT

Then, check that GPU stack got initialized for your platform (DG2 or ATS-M)::

  $ dmesg | grep drm

In the above log make sure that:

* GuC, HuC and DMC Firmware was loaded (note: ATS-M reuses DG2 firmware)
* HuC got authenticated

Once host setup is done, you can try media-delivery sample included in this repository. Refer
to the top level `README <../README.rst>`_ for details. In short, to build docker compatible with the
host setup we just did, execute (from the top level of media-delivery cloned copy)::

  docker build \
    $(env | grep -E '(_proxy=|_PROXY)' | sed 's/^/--build-arg /') \
    --file docker/ubuntu20.04/selfbuild/Dockerfile \
    --tag intel-media-delivery \
    .
